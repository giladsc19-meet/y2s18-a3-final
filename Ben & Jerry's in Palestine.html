<span class="myriad16"> That’s why we’ve called for a <a href="https://vtjp.org/icecream/boycott.htm">boycott</a> of Ben &amp; Jerry’s.   
<br>
In violation of their social mission, their Israeli franchise sells ice cream in illegal, Jewish-only settlements in the occupied West Bank and
East Jerusalem, transported on Jewish-only roads, on trucks with Jewish-only license plates, passing easily through military checkpoints that bedevil others.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; So much for their <a href="https://www.benjerry.com/values">social mission</a>.
<br>
Since 2013, thousands of individuals and <a href="https://vtjp.org/icecream/internatletter.html">nearly 250 organizations</a> in 20 countries have called on Ben &amp;
Jerry’s to stop sales to Israeli illegal settlements and to publicly oppose Israel’s occupation and settlements.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;They have refused to do so.

<center><h3><b>VTJP Urges Unilever to Stop the Sale of Ben&amp; Jerry's Ice Cream in Occupied Palestine</b></h3>
<strong><span style="font-size:18px">But Unilever does not Respond</span></strong></center>
<p>In April, and again in May 2018, VTJP wrote to the executive management team of Unilever in the Netherlands.  Ben &amp; Jerry's is a subsidiary of Unilever, a British-Dutch conglomerate which bought the Vermont company in 2001.
</p><p>The <a href="https://vtjp.org/pdfs/Unilever24-April-2018.pdf">first letter</a> urged the company "to intervene immediately and decisively, as Ben &amp; Jerry's parent company, to put a stop to your U.S. subsidiary's commerce conducted by its Israeli franchise in Israel's illegal, Jewish-only settlements in the occupied West Bank and East Jerusalem."
</p><p>The letter charted the history of Ben &amp; Jerry's complicity with Israel's occupation and settlement regime, in violation of international law, and VTJP's efforts to put an end to it since 2011.  It also noted the allegation VTJP made in 2014, based on information from Israeli activists, that Ben &amp; Jerry's franchise in Israel purchases equipment from an illegal settlement in the occupied Golan Heights of Syria.  
</p><p>Unilever did not respond to the letter, but, directed, we believe, Jostein Solheim to do so.  He is Ben &amp; Jerry's CEO in South Burlington, Vermont.
Mr. Solheim sent VTJP <a href="https://vtjp.org/pdfs/SolheimResponse.pdf">a letter</a> dated May 4th 2018. It spun Ben &amp; Jerry's complicity with Israel's military occupation and settlements as a form of "economic cooperation" and "engagement" designed to "resolve conflicts," promote "social equity," and help "marginalized peoples." It also attempted to justify the company's commerce in occupied Palestine on the basis of protocols signed by Israel and the Palestinian Authority in 1994 (which are part of the failed and discredited Oslo Accords.) 
</p><p>Once again, Mr. Solheim did not make a single reference to the occupation or Israel's settlements - an omission more striking than normal given that it came during the period of massive protests in Gaza (The Great March of Return) and the slaughter and maiming of nonviolent protesters by Israeli snipers.
</p><p>VTJP rebutted Solheim's points in its <a href="https://vtjp.org/pdfs/Unilever18-May-2018.pdf">second letter</a> to Unilever in May, and expressed again its desire to engage Unilever directly.  We have yet to receive a response to the second letter (July 2018). <br>

This year (2018) hundreds of people sent emails to the Ben &amp; Jerry's Management, Board and Founders about sales of their ice cream in illegal Jewish-only settlements in occupied Palestine, and their failure to live up to their declared Social Mission.  Others left phone messages for the company's Global Director of Social Mission.   And people handed out leaflets at scoop shops for those in line for their free ice cream.<br>

Even more Ben &amp; Jerry's ice cream will now be sold in illegal Jewish-only settlements in the West Bank as the Netanyahu-Trump collaborative plans 2500 more residential homes for construction in illegal settlements.  This was reported on January 24th 2017<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/jan/24/israel-announces-2500-more-west-bank-settlement-homes"> by the Guardian newspaper</a> and the <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-38734956">BBC</a>. This is in addition to plans for additional construction in East Jerusalem to consolidate its annexation.

		  <h3>Ben &amp; Jerry's:  Why do Palestinian Lives not Matter to You?<br></h3>

<br>
We commend Ben &amp; Jerry's for taking the brave step of aligning the company with the Black Lives Matter movement in a <a href="https://www.benjerry.com/whats-new/why-black-lives-matter">statement</a> posted October 6th 2016.  But the company continues to miss opportunities to take specific actions to show that it respects the lives of Palestinian refugees and Palestinians living under occupation.
<br><br>
Many activists in the 'Black Lives Matter' movement identify their struggle with the struggle for human rights of Palestinians who are denied basic freedoms by the Israeli occupation <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsdpg-9cmSw">(When I see them I see us)</a>.  Ben &amp; Jerry's statement says "we have a moral obligation to take a stand now for justice and for Black lives."  And yet by failing to speak out against the occupation they have shown little interest in justice for Palestinians.  The company continues to sell ice cream in illegal Jewish-only settlements and to send ice cream treats to Israeli soldiers of the occupation forces.
<br><br>
Ben &amp; Jerry's statement says "All lives do matter. But all lives will not matter until Black lives matter."  As the Black Lives Matter movement has made perfectly clear, <i>all lives</i> include oppressed Palestinians as well as oppressed people of color in the US.
<br><br>The statement continues: "We’ve come to understand that to be silent about the violence and threats to the lives and well-being of Black people is to be complicit in that violence and those threats."  That's what we’ve been saying to Ben &amp; Jerry's for 4 years now - that to be silent about the occupation of Palestine, which daily humiliates and brutalizes 4 million Palestinians, is to be complicit in the crimes committed by Israel's government and occupation forces.
<br><br>
Ben &amp; Jerry's could take immediate constructive steps by speaking out against the occupation and by stopping sales of their ice cream in the settlements. <b>But Palestinians' lives apparently do not matter enough.</b>

<h3><b>Ben &amp; Jerry's Business in Israeli Settlements Brings Divestment Pressure on Parent Company Unilever </b></h3>
Ben &amp; Jerry's refusal to stop the sale of its ice cream in illegal, Jewish-only settlements in Occupied Palestine is having repercussions for Unilever, its parent company. 		
<p>
The British organization <a href="https://www.embraceme.org/" target="_blank">Embrace the Middle East</a> 
has sold its holdings in Unilever, because its subsidiary, Ben &amp; Jerry's, markets and sells ice cream in Israeli settlements.  This according to Jeremy Moodey in an <a href="https://www.christiantoday.com/article/uk.anti.boycott.rules.5.reasons.why.they.are.undemocratic.and.wrong/" target="_blank">article</a>  titled <i>"UK anti-boycott rules: 5 reasons why they are undemocratic and wrong"</i> in the publication "Christian Today".  Ben &amp; Jerry's and Unilever should both take note.
</p><p>
In <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jan/25/unilever-ceo-paul-polman-the-optimistic-pessimist" target="_blank">an article</a> in the Guardian newspaper, Unilever CEO Paul Polman was quoted as saying "There are many people now that don’t want to invest in companies that create a worse future for their grandchildren."</p><p>
Unilever is an Anglo-Dutch multinational consumer goods company co-headquartered in Rotterdam, Netherlands, and London, UK.

</div><div style="margin-left: 300px;">			
		  <h3><b>Ben &amp; Jerry's Apartheid Wall</b></h3>
Israel has its infamous apartheid wall, but humans, too, build walls — internally. Jeff Furman, the chair of Ben &amp; Jerry's board of directors, is a case in point.
<br>Recently VTJP wrote a <a href="https://vtjp.org/icecream/ToSolheim_ReOmar.pdf" target="_blank">letter</a> to Ben &amp;
Jerry's Board of Directors Chair, Jeff Furman, a long-time civil rights
activist and progressive voice in support of Palestinian rights.&nbsp; We asked him
and Ben &amp; Jerry's CEO Jostein Solheim to publicly condemn the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ukXAFxI8Ix4" target="_blank">ominous
targeting</a> of Israeli Palestinian BDS co-founder Omar Bargouti by the Israeli
Minister of Intelligence for "targeted civil thwarting".&nbsp; In this interview, the Minister makes accusations against Mr.
Bargouti, insinuating that he and other BDS activists have ties to terrorist
organisations, without giving any evidence.&nbsp; When we received no response from
either Mr. Furman or Mr. Solheim we called on our supporters to personally
email them requesting appropriate action.&nbsp;&nbsp;Over 100
individuals wrote personal (not 'form') emails.<br><br>

Mr. Furman <a href="https://vtjp.org/icecream/FurmanReply.pdf" target="_blank">did respond</a>, but only as an individual not as an official (Chairman of the Board of Directors) of Ben &amp;
Jerry's. It is convenient to hide behind the
powerlessness of one's individual's voice, to wring one's hands in anguish that
Omar Bargouti's life has been threatened by Israeli officials, and to sign an
online petition in his support as an example of the only thing that one can do.
But this is the essence of PEP, Progressive Except for Palestine, and the stand
that Ben and Jerry's, the Vermont-based company takes.&nbsp; They and Mr. Furman
have built their own convenient wall to stand behind, denying the fact that
their existence in Israel and their ice cream sales within the illegal Jewish
settlements contributes to the normalisation of the egregious oppression of
the Palestinian people.<br><br>

Mr. Furman to his credit has personally met
with Mr. Bargouti and is in a position to do much more than sign an email petition
on Mr. Bargouti's behalf.&nbsp; As Chairman of the BOD he could come out from behind
his self-made Apartheid wall and take the public stand, that Israel's latest
wrong against non-violent resistant must be sanctioned publicly.

Every year, Ben &amp; Jerry's serves 'free' cones at scoop shops.  <i>"Your Ice Cream is Free, but Palestinians are Not! "</i>.  This year it was on April 11th 2016 and, as in the previous 3 years, volunteers took advantage of this opportunity to hand out leaflets to people waiting in line, and to talk about Ben &amp; Jerry's complicity in the illegal and immoral occupation and colonization of Palestine.  This year over 2500 leaflets were handed out in ten cities in eight US States, as well as in Montréal Québec.

<h3><b>Targeted Killing of BDS People</b></h3>
On April 6 2016, we wrote a <a href="https://vtjp.org/icecream/ToSolheim_ReOmar.pdf" target="_blank">letter</a> to Ben &amp; Jerry's calling on the " Peace and Love"  company to condemn recent threats by Israeli officials against Omar Barghouti and other Palestinian BDS activists. 
<br>
The Israeli Minister of Transportation, Intelligence and Atomic energy, Yisrael Katz, had said that Israel must carry out a "targeted civil thwarting of the BDS leadership," naming Omar Barghouti and other activists. ("Targeted thwarting"  is an Israeli military term for "assassination").  Additionally, according to Israeli Interior Minister Aryeh Deri, the revocation of Mr. Barghouti’s permanent residency status in Israel is being contemplated in retaliation for his BDS organizing. 
<br>
Our letter requested Ben &amp; Jerry's to "issue a strong public statement condemning the recent attacks against Omar Barghouti and other BDS activists, and demanding that the government of Israel put a stop to them immediately and take all necessary measures to protect the lives of these activists and to defend their human and civil rights."

VASSAR <i>Students for Justice in Palestine</i> (SJP) Calls Out Ben &amp; Jerry's
<br>in Passing BDS Resolution
<br>
On March 6th 2016, the Vassar Student Association (VSA) voted to endorse the Palestinian-led international Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions (BDS) movement in support of Palestinian rights and an end to Israeli human rights abuses. The <a href="https://vsa.vassar.edu/orgs/vassarsjp/bds-resolution/" target="_blank"> Students for Justice in Palestine (SJP) BDS resolution</a> was passed by a vote of 15 in favor and 7 opposed. 
<br>
VTJP <a href="https://vtjp.org/icecream/VassarLetter.pdf" target="_blank">wrote</a> expressed its deep gratitude to Vassar SJP for including Ben &amp; Jerry's in the resolution because of its Israeli franchise’s commercial complicity with illegal, Jewish-only settlements. The other listed companies listed are: the Strauss Group, the Osem Group, Hewlett-Packard Company, Ahava, General Electric, Eden Springs, Motorola, Caterpillar, G4S, and Elbit Systems.
<br>
A bylaw amendment that would have prevented VSA funds from being spent on products listed in the resolution did not secure the needed 2/3 majority to be adopted; it failed by a vote of 12 in favor to 10 opposed.  Considerable pressure was brought to bear on VSA by the college’s Board of Trustees and senior-level administrators.  They told student leaders that if the bylaw amendment passed the administration would assume control over the VSA’s $900,000 activities budget. 
<br>
Vassar’s BDS activists <a href="https://vsa.vassar.edu/orgs/vassarsjp/2016/03/07/vassar-student-association-passes-bds-resolution/" target="_blank"> protested</a> these threats as "a coercive tactic and represent a clear betrayal of the principle of shared governance between students and administrators central to the VSA and the functioning of the College more broadly."

Occupation, Inc.<br>
How Settlement Businesses Contribute to Israel’s Violations of Palestinian Rights
<br></b></h3>
The report makes three major recommendations to businesses active in Israeli settlements:<br>
<i>- Cease activities carried out inside settlements;<br>
- Avoid financing, administering or otherwise supporting settlements or settlement related activities and infrastructure,  to ensure the businesses are not indirectly contributing to and benefiting from such activities;<br>
- Conduct human rights due diligence.</i><br>
The report documents in over 100 pages how almost immediately after Israel's military occupation of the West Bank in 1967 the Israeli government began establishing settlements in the occupied Palestinian territories.
<br>From the outset, private businesses have been involved in Israel's settlement policies,
benefiting from and contributing to them. 
<br>The report details the ways in which Israeli and international businesses have helped to build, finance, service, and market settlement communities. Businesses are drawn to settlements by low rents, favorable tax rates, government subsidies, and access to cheap Palestinian labor.

		  <h3><b>Art Hop 2015 in Burlington,VT.</b></h3>
This year the Art Hop – weekend of September 11-13, 2015 - included a powerful 'comic strip' installation with artwork by <a href="https://mikasa423.wordpress.com/">Michelle Sayles</a> in collaboration with Jen Berger. A series of 8 panels tells one woman’s story of military occupation and oppression over 8 decades.   The Ben &amp; Jerry's 'free' ice cream truck was located across the street from the 'comic strip' art installation.  Many people were visibly moved by the art installation and the story it tells.
<br>
Our action also included a performance of the <a href="https://vtjp.org/icecream/cantastoria.html">Cantastoria</a> about Ben &amp; Jerry's in Palestine for the people waiting in line for 'free' ice cream (performance by Mark Hage).  Leaflets about Ben &amp; Jerry's in occupied Palestine were handed out to people viewing the art, and those waiting for 'free' ice cream cones.  Many people were visibly moved by the art installation and the story it tells.
<br><br>
The <a href="https://seaba.com/art-hop/">South End Art Hop</a> attracts over 30,000 visitors to artist’s studios and local businesses that become exhibition sites for the more than 500 participating artists.

		  <h3><b>Re-Directing Mis-Direction - Ben &amp; Jerry's Tries to Defend the Indefensible</b></h3>
		  On April 10th 2015, just before this year’s 3rd annual Free Cone Day protests at Ben &amp; Jerry's scoop shops, the company posted <a href="https://www.benjerry.com/whats-new/ben-and-jerrys-business-in-israel">this statement</a> on its website.  Here is the full text of <a href="https://vtjp.org/icecream/Response_to_B&amp;J_Statement_of_4-10-15.pdf">our response.</a>
<br><br>
As in previous statements, this one deliberately sidesteps Ben &amp; Jerry's responsibility for its Israeli franchise’s <a href="https://vtjp.org/icecream">selling ice cream</a> in illegal, Jewish-only settlements in the occupied Palestinian territories, and does not even mention the settlements or the use of Jewish-only roads to transport the company’s products.  <br><br> 
Ben &amp; Jerry's assures us it is "keenly aware of how complex the situation can be".  The "situation" is not complex. This is a military occupation and a criminal enterprise of settler-colonialism, apartheid and ethnic cleansing, now in its 49th year. <br> <br>
Members of the Company management and Board of Directors delegation who visited the region are not unobservant or unethical people. They are aware of international law and they know that Israel’s occupation will never be terminated, or substantially mitigated, by company-funded efforts at "cross-cultural understanding" or "sourcing from local Fair Trade farmers."  </div>

</div> <div style="margin-left: 300px;">
<p>
This latest statement is a clear case of <a href="https://vtjp.org/icecream/MISDIRECTION.pdf">"misdirection"</a>   It deflects attention from the company’s "values-based" <a href="https://www.benjerry.com/values">social mission</a> and from of what is really going on in Occupied Palestine.  It also confirms our decision to organize a boycott of the company.

			<h3><b>Center for Constitutional Rights defends criticism of Israel</b></h3>
 The <a href="https://ccrjustice.org/home/what-we-do/issues/palestinian-solidarity">Center for Constitutional Rights</a> released <a href="https://ccrjustice.org/the-palestine-exception" target="_blank">findings</a> (on May 18th, 2015) regarding the increasing use of accusations of anti-Semitism on U.S. college campuses to suppress speech critical of Israeli policy. 60 incidents were documented in the first 4 months of 2015 involving accusations of anti-Semitism made against students or faculty and 24 incidents involving accusations that students or faculty were “terrorists” or “supporters of terrorism,” based solely on speech critical of Israeli policy. This violates the free speech rights of students and scholars and undercuts the university as a place of debate and critical thinking, while also detracting from the fight against true anti-Semitism. The same day, <a href="https://www.jvp.org/">Jewish Voice for Peace</a> delivered a letter signed by over 250 academics to the U.S. State Department, asking it to revise its definition of anti-Semitism to prevent this charge being misused to silence critics of Israel.

<h3><b>Free Cone Day Actions - April 14th 2015</b></h3>
For the third consecutive year, volunteers engaged with people waiting in line at Ben &amp; Jerry's "Free Cone Day " and handed out leaflets.
<a href="https://vtjp.org/icecream/FCD-2015-Report.php">Here's a report</a> of actions at 18 scoop shop locations in 7 different States.  Thousands of leaflets were distributed, and many people in line were surprised to learn about the occupation and our campaign and eager to find out more.  This event is an ideal opportunity to let people know about the illegal occupation of Palestine and the oppression of Palestinians, and the illegal Jewish-only settlements where Ben &amp; Jerry's ice cream is being sold, thus helping to 'normalize' the occupation.<br>
And here is a link to the <a href="https://vimeo.com/126744308">Cantastoria</a>, performed for waiting Free Cone devotees at the 'Flagship' Scoop Shop in Burlington, VT.
